  <h4>
    THE VERY FAMOUS GOLDEN RATIO
  </h4>
  <p>
    Many architects and artists convey the concept of infinity through the use of patterns, symmetry, and mathematical proportions—most notably the Golden Ratio, which is closely linked to the infinite Fibonacci sequence. This "divine proportion" is not only rooted in mathematics but also mirrors the structure and balance found in nature, from the spiral of a nautilus shell to the branching of trees. By integrating this ratio into their works, creators achieve a sense of harmony and continuity that feels both timeless and intuitively beautiful. Whether in painting, sculpture, or architecture, the Golden Ratio serves as a bridge between human creativity and the natural world's inherent order.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes it is also referred to as the golden section, the golden mean, the golden number, the divine proportion, or the golden proportion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The example below shows how the golden ratio looks – it appears as a large rectangle, divided into a series of squares. In order to find the exact proportions of the golden ratio, you can divide a rectangle into two, making sure the longer part divided by the smaller part is equal to the whole length divided by the long part. As you can see in the example below, the sequence of divisions can carry on ad infinitum in a curve.

  <p>
    The mathematician Martin Ohm first coined the term ‘golden ratio’ in Die Reine Elementar-Mathematik (The Pure Elementary Mathematics), in 1815, but by then, many artists and designers had already made use of the compositional technique.

  <h4>
    Hokusai, The Great Wave off Kanagawa, 1831
  </h4>
  <p>
    Japanese artist Hokusai’s iconic ukiyo-e print The Great Wave off Kanagawa, made in 1831, is a more recent example of the golden ratio. While the wave may at first appear wild and spontaneous, closer examination reveals that Hokusai has in fact made a mathematically ordered design, in which a series of curved lines follow the golden ratio sequence. Thus Hokusai observes that even in its seemingly wildest moments, there is often pattern and structure underneath the forces of nature.

  <h4>Mirror Rooms</h4>
  <p>Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirror Rooms bring the idea of infinity to life through mirrors and repeating patterns that surround and reflect the viewer. First introduced in her 1965 work Infinity Mirror Room (Phalli’s Field), these installations allowed her to move beyond the physical limits of making each object by hand, using mirrors to multiply forms endlessly. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The experience is both visual and emotional as viewers see themselves reflected in a space that seems to go on forever, creating a feeling of being part of something much larger. With themes of repetition, self-loss, and connection to the universe, Kusama’s rooms offer a powerful and immersive way to explore the idea of infinity.

  <h4>
    Tesselation
  </h4>
  <p>What do honeycombs, tiled floors, and video games have in common? Have you ever looked at a sidewalk, a mosaic, or even your bedsheet and found yourself drawn into a pattern that seems to go on forever? 
  </p>
  <p>
    These repeating shapes, called tessellations, are more than just beautiful designs; they are mathematics in action, and they hold a powerful connection to the concept of infinity. Tessellations are patterns made of shapes that fit together perfectly without gaps or overlaps, and they can extend endlessly in every direction. 
  </p>
  <p>Many of the works by Dutch artist Maurits Cornelis (M.C.) Escher are deeply linked to mathematical ideas of infinity and paradox. Whether it’s lizards crawling across endlessly tiled planes or shapes shrinking into the distance in his Circle Limit series, Escher used geometry, symmetry, and optical illusion to suggest boundless space. Inspired by both the rigid rules of mathematics and the organic beauty of nature, his work blurs the line between order and imagination. In pieces like “Liberation”, geometric patterns morph into flying birds, suggesting a release from constraint into infinite possibility.

  <h4>
    Möbius Strip
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Möbius strip is a two-dimensional surface with only one side and one edge. This means that if you were to follow an ant crawling along it, you would eventually return to your starting point having traversed both the top and bottom of the strip without ever leaving it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The strip's continuous, closed loop gives it an almost infinite appearance, as it seemingly has no beginning or end—but while the strip evokes a sense of infinity, it's important to remember that the mathematical symbol for infinity (∞) represents an unlimited quantity or extent, while the Möbius strip is a specific geometric shape.
