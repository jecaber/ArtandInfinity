  <h4>Corbusierhaus (Unité d’Habitation)
</h4>
  <p>
    Le Corbusier was one of the most influential architects of the Modernist movement, known for his innovative approach to design and urban planning. He drew significant inspiration from the Golden Ratio, particularly through Leonardo da Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man,” which symbolizes ideal human proportions. Le Corbusier believed that architecture should be in harmony with the human body and developed a proportional system called the Modulor, based on the Golden Ratio and human measurements. This system guided the dimensions and layout of many of his buildings, aiming to create spaces that were not only functional but also intuitively pleasing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Structures such as the Unité d'Habitation in Marseille reflect his use of these principles, balancing mathematical order with human scale to enhance both aesthetic appeal and usability.
