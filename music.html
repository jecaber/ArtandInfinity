  <h4>Some people have lives; some people have music.</h4>
  <p>
    A lot of musical artists do sing about the concept of infinity itself, too! Some even incorporate it into their song’s form—there are instances where a song doesn’t seemingly “end”, its volume only gets low and lower; and example of this is the song The Louvre by Lorde.

  <h4>
    Limitless Combinations!
  </h4>
  <p>
    Even with a finite set of notes, the number of possible melodies, harmonies, and rhythmic patterns is practically infinite. Leonard Bernstein, in his 1959 lecture, emphasized the vastness of musical permutations, highlighting the immense richness of musical variation.

  <h4>
    Shepard Tones
  </h4>
  <p>
    Shepard tones are an audio illusion that creates the perception of a pitch continually rising or falling, even though it doesn't actually change. This is achieved by overlapping multiple versions of the same note, each an octave apart, and manipulating the volume of each to create a sense of a never-ending climb or descent.

  <h4>
    Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time"
  </h4>
  <p>
    Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time" explores the concept of infinity through its mystical and spiritual themes, referencing the Book of Revelation and the idea of "no more time". The composition, created in a prisoner of war camp, uses techniques like isorhythm and modes of limited transposition to represent the infinite and beyond time.
