  <h4>Art</h4>
  <p>
    The dictionary definition of art says that it is “the conscious use of skill and creative imagination, especially in the production of aesthetic objects” (Merriam-Webster). Art is essential to society as it stimulates creativity, reflects culture, fosters empathy, provokes thought, and offers a medium for expression. It enhances society’s intellectual and emotional understanding of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many common definitions of art as per many books by famous artists and authors. Few to quote:

    <li>
      an activity that manifests beauty
    </li>
    <li>
      the mastery, an ideal way of doing things
    </li>
    <li>
      the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known
    </li>
    <li>
      discovery and development of elementary principles of nature into beautiful forms suitable for human use (Frank Lloyd Wright)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Categories of Art</h4>

  <h4> Infinity</h4>
  <p>The infinity symbol looks like a horizontal version of number 8 and it represents the concept of eternity, endless and unlimited.</p>
  <p>Infinity is a mathematical concept that is used to represent a value that is immeasurably large and cannot be assigned any kind of actual numerical value. It is an endless value that cannot be defined. In mathematics, infinite mathematical objects can be studied, manipulated, and used just like any other mathematical object.</p>

  <h6>Did you know?</h6>
  <p>A loop can be an example of infinity if it runs without a stopping condition, which is called an infinite loop—otherwise, it's just a repeated process with a defined end.
